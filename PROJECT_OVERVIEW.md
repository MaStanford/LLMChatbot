# Project Overview: Android Chatbot

## 1. Purpose

This project is a self-driven initiative to prepare for an Android developer interview at xAI. The primary goal is to build a functional, modern Android application that demonstrates proficiency with the latest Jetpack libraries and modern architectural patterns.

The author, a Google engineer with a background in traditional Android development (plain Java, platform apps), is using this project to rapidly learn and apply contemporary concepts like Jetpack Compose, Clean Architecture, Coroutines, and Dependency Injection with Hilt.

## 2. Core Concept

The application is an LLM-powered chatbot. The core technical challenge is to create an "endless scrolling" chat interface where the response from the Large Language Model streams in token-by-token, mimicking a live typing effect.

This serves as a practical and relevant way to handle asynchronous data streams, manage UI state, and build a reactive, modern user interface.

## 3. Learning Objectives

-   **Modern UI:** Master Jetpack Compose for building a declarative, dynamic UI.
-   **Architecture:** Implement a robust and scalable Clean Architecture.
-   **Asynchronous Programming:** Utilize Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for managing background tasks and data streams.
-   **Dependency Injection:** Use Hilt for managing dependencies and building a modular codebase.
-   **Database:** Leverage Room for local persistence of chat history.
-   **Settings:** Use DataStore for storing user preferences.
-   **Lifecycle Management:** Employ ViewModels and Lifecycle-aware components to build a stable and efficient app.
-   **Navigation:** Implement a single-activity architecture using the Jetpack Navigation component.
